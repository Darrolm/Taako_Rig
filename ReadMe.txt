Taako Rig

05 - 29 - 19

Version 0.6

State of the rig:

- Core body rig is present with IK/FK limbs.

- Helper systems in place for the shawl, lower shirt, and the shirt cuffs. These systems have an auto function that is on by default but can be disabled or only partially used. The shawl's are on the Chest control, shirt on the CoG control, and cuffs on the Hand settings control. The cuff's control visibility is currently missing in this version.

= Hair control visibility can be toggled on the head control. 

- Glasses don't fold yet and are currently tied only to the hat while the hat is only in Head space.

To-do List:

- I want to add a squash to the puffy part of the sleeves for when the arms are at his side.

- The face rig hasn't even been started yet

- Space settings for hat, glasses, arms, legs.

- Mass clean up to verify each control doesn't have more attributes than it should while locking attributes on null layers.

- Rework Umbrastaff rig for stability. It's occasionally wonky at the moment.

- Import Umbrastaff rig into primary character file

- Potentially set up the controls using Maya 2018 and beyond controller tags? 

- Potentially create a GUI with Python or PyQT.

- I'm open to suggestions and feedback.
