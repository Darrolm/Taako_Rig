Taako Rig

05 - 29 - 19

Version 0.7

State of the rig:

- Core body rig is present with IK/FK limbs.

- Helper systems in place for the shawl, lower shirt, and the shirt cuffs. These systems have an auto function that is on by default but can be disabled or only partially used. The shawl's are on the Chest control, shirt on the CoG control, and cuffs on the Hand settings control. The cuff's control visibility is currently missing in this version.

- Hair control visibility can be toggled on the head control. 

- Glasses don't fold yet and are currently tied only to the hat while the hat is only in Head space.

- Space switch is there for the IK controls, the hat, glasses, UmbraStaff, and eye controls.

To-do List:
- Fully integrate the UmbraStaff into the Taako rig - There are current scaling issues when it comes to the shield geo.

- I want to add a squash to the puffy part of the sleeves for when the arms are at his side.

- The face rig hasn't even been started yet

- Rework Umbrastaff rig for stability. It is occasionally wonky at the moment.

- Set up controller tags 

- Potentially create a GUI with Python or PyQT.

- I'm open to suggestions and feedback.
